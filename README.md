qBittorrent Windows Automatic batch file command line script to check torrent for seeders if it has no seeders it will delete the torrent automatically I did not like the way there was no automation to the way qBittorent deals with torrent files so i built in a automatic process that will run every hour to deal with and clean up the torrents that get added.
